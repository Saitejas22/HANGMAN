## Introduction

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game. Players try to guess the letters in a word, one at a time. If they guess a correct letter, it is revealed in the word. If they guess incorrectly, they lose one of their limited attempts. The game continues until the player guesses the entire word or runs out of attempts.

## Features

- **Simple Command-Line Interface**: Easy to play and interact with.
- **Word List**: The game uses a predefined list of words for the player to guess.
- **Attempt Tracking**: The game keeps track of the number of incorrect guesses and remaining attempts.
- **Feedback**: Provides feedback for each guess, showing correctly guessed letters and positions.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**

## Usage

### Playing the Game

1. **Start the game**:
    Run the `hangman.py` file using Python.

2. **Guess letters**:
    - The game will prompt you to enter a letter.
    - If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the correct position(s).
    - If the letter is not in the word, you will lose one attempt.

3. **Win or Lose**:
    - Continue guessing letters until you either guess the entire word or run out of attempts.
    - The game will display a win or lose message accordingly.

### Customization

You can customize the list of words used in the game by modifying the `words.txt` file (or any file where you store the words):

1. Open the `words.txt` file in a text editor.
2. Add or remove words, each word on a new line.
