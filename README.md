Introduction
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game. Players try to guess the letters in a word, one at a time. If they guess a correct letter, it is revealed in the word. If they guess incorrectly, they lose one of their limited attempts. The game continues until the player guesses the entire word or runs out of attempts.

Features
Simple Command-Line Interface: Easy to play and interact with.
Word List: The game uses a predefined list of words for the player to guess.
Attempt Tracking: The game keeps track of the number of incorrect guesses and remaining attempts.
Feedback: Provides feedback for each guess, showing correctly guessed letters and positions.
Requirements
Python 3.x
